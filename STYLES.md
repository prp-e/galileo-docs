# Style Guide

| Style Token | Style Name | Description |
|:--------|:--------|:---------------------------|
| `nostyle`| No style | This is the pure/raw images from our model. It works somehow like when you provide no information to Dall-E or Midjourney |
| `raw`    | Raw Photo | This style has some photorealism style, adds analog and film-grain vibes as well |
| `logo`   | Logo      | You can use this if you're making Logos |
| `tshirt` | T-Shirt   | If you want to _wear your dreams_ I guess this is your perfect style |
| `double_exposure` | Double Exposure | This is for double exposure photos. The model is a little weak on this style for now |
| `sticker` | Sticker | If you want to make beautiful die-cut stickers, use this style |
